# Periodic-Table-JSON
A json of the entire periodic table. Feel free to use it in your projects.

<p>
Temperatures such as boiling points and melting points are given in degrees kelvin.
Densities are given in g/L and molar heat in (mol*K)
Information that is missing is repersented as null. Some elements may have an image link to their spectral bands.
All elements have a three sentence summary from wikipedia. Currently the color tag is useless, so please use appearance instead.</p>
<p>A link to the source where the information was from is provided in each element under the key "source"
</p>

<p>Here's an example of how it's formatted: </p>
